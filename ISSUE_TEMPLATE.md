# I want to file an Issue!
Goodie for you!  Please use one of the following templates below in order to help me with sorting and whatnaught.

## Your stuff doesn't work the way I think it should!
Are you sure?  I try my best to test my stuff so please take a moment to make sure that the issue you're running into isn't user 
error (i.e., I'm blaming you becuase I know how awesome I am).  If, however, you are dead certain that its my fault, please use the
the following template to explain how I screwed up and how you're so much smarter than me

### Template
-----------------------
## Feature that behaves incorrectly

## How this feature SHOULD be working

## Pull request with a unit test that should pass once the issue is fixed (brownie points if you do this)

-----------------------

## Why haven't you implementated my really cool idea yet?!?
Because you haven't told me what it is yet.  Take a moment and make sure you have your thoughts together before you write this.
The heavier your change is, the more details I expect to see on what the advantages of such a change will be.  

### Template 
-----------------------
## What shortcoming will this fix cover

## Why its important to make this change

## How much time I would invest in making this patch (if I had the free time to do it)

-----------------------

## I read your documentation, but, despite you're incredible control of the English language and ability to converse about complex Java stuffs via sarcastic comments, I'm incapable of understanding how this thing should work.
Coolio, questions are easy issues to close and make me feel good about myself

### Template
-----------------------
## What am I missing here?
